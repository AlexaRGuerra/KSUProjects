# Part 1(H): Analysis and interpretation
# To begin with, the pricing and volume demonstrated in the diagram suggest that Microsoft stocks fluctuated and remained consistent after 2012 as it continued to increase. 
# For example, in the beginning of 2001 there was a slight increase in the price of stocks then it decreased in 2003. 
# After 2003 the stock seemed never to remain constant. In 2009, one can observe that Microsoft endured a drop in its annual revenue. 
# The drop occurred due to the global recession. However, after the recession, Microsoft was able to increase their profits. 
# Furthermore, the time plot of daily returns suggests that it remained pretty consistent as the chart remains steady. 
# Overall, based on the findings, it shows that Microsoft has continued to increase.
